I've had a long and joyful time programming on khanacademy with my second account (first was deactivated by family court) all the way since January 2016. I've transitioned into more advanced web development with js and jquery, css and html, so this will be a complete compilation of all my projects on that khan academy profile. 

Khanacademy runs programs on their own version of processing.js, a javascript port of the Processing language. That is how I got started with computing in general, in August of 2015 (first account). It is also the language that I'm best at programming graphics in and I'll give myself a good score on how far I've gotten with it (finished sections "Intro", "Natural Simulations", and part of "Visualizations"). You'll see some html code and that's from some of my 2016 work learning html. 

I have a total of 65 programs. They'll be named (thus sorted) according to date created, but some of my more exciting projects come up more recently. To actually run these programs outside of the khanacademy code editor you will have to look into this Stackoverflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25341597/how-can-khan-academy-computer-programs-be-run-offline-or-on-my-own-website Also, this repository will preserve everything up to the indentation of my original code because I'll be copy pasting everything. 

By the way the titles for the commits of each program are the exact titles I had for the original khanacademy programs.
